Web Termsly | AI Risk Analysis Dashboard
Web Termsly is an intelligent risk analysis tool designed to decode complex "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" agreements. Legal documents are often too long and complex for the average user to read. Termsly solves this by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to scan websites, flag high-risk legal clauses, summarize content, and translate findings into regional languages.

Here is a polished, professional, and fully structured README.md for Web Termsly.

I have consolidated the duplicate sections, formatted the dataset statistics into a clean table, added specific installation commands (which were missing), and improved the visual hierarchy.

Web Termsly is an intelligent risk analysis tool designed to decode complex "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" agreements. Legal documents are often too long and complex for the average user to read. Termsly solves this by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to scan websites, flag high-risk legal clauses, summarize content, and translate findings into regional languages.

🚀 Key Features
🌐 Automated Scraper: Utilizes Selenium and BeautifulSoup to autonomously navigate to a target domain, identify policy links, and extract relevant text.

⚖️ AI Risk Classification: A Logistic Regression model classifies individual clauses into High 🔴, Medium 🟠, or Safe 🟢 categories based on legal risk patterns.

📝 Smart Summarization: Compresses long, technical legal text into a concise, easy-to-read executive summary using the T5 Transformer model.

🗣️ Multi-Language Support: Breaks language barriers by translating summaries into Bengali, Hindi, Tamil, French, and Russian.

📊 Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly Streamlit interface that provides visual risk distribution charts and instant feedback.

📄 Instant PDF Reports: Generates downloadable, color-coded PDF reports with embedded fonts for Indic languages.

📊 Dataset & Risk Logic
The Machine Learning model behind Termsly was trained on a custom dataset of policy clauses labeled by risk level.

Dataset Distribution
The training data (policies_dataset.csv) is balanced to ensure fair detection across categories:

Risk Level,Label,Count,Ratio,Description
Safe,🟢,302,34.28%,"Standard, non-intrusive clauses."
High,🔴,297,33.71%,"Risky clauses (e.g., data selling, waivers)."
Medium,🟠,282,32.01%,"Moderate clauses (e.g., analytics sharing)."


How Risk is Calculated
Termsly employs a transparent, quantitative approach to risk detection:

Granular Analysis: The model splits the document into individual sentences and classifies each one.

Scoring Logic: We determine the overall risk level by analyzing the volume of risky terms found.

Transparency: Unlike tools that hide details, Termsly highlights every High and Medium risk clause detected, ensuring users see the full scope of potential issues.
